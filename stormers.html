        <p> Rayn played at provincial level for the WP u/16 and u/18 teams, between 2008 and 2010. Once he left school, he played for both the u/19 and u/21 WP teams as a regualr starter.
            He was first included in the Western Province senior side for the 2013 Vodacom Cup competition. His first class debut came in their opening match of the season against near neighbours Boland Cavaliers. He scored his first senior try in their next match, at home to the Sharks XV and eventually started all nine of Western Province's matches during the competition.
            His first appearance in the Currie Cup came a few months later, during the 2013 Currie Cup competition. He started the match against Griquas following a late injury to Rynhardt Elstadt, which was his only appearance in the competition.
            He was also included in the Stormers wider training squad for the 2014 Super Rugby season.
            At the end of 2014, Smid joined Italian side I Cavalieri on a short-term deal. He made two appearances for them in the 2014â€“2015 National Championship of Excellence and one in the 2015 Trophy of Excellence before returning to Cape Town prior to the 2015 Vodacom Cup competition.</p>
